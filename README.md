# 🐾 2D Endless Runner (MonoGame)

A **pixel-style endless runner** game built with **C# and MonoGame**, featuring a playful cat protagonist that jumps, crouches, and dodges obstacles in an infinite world.  
This project demonstrates **game physics, animation handling, asset management, and collision detection** using the MonoGame framework.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎮 Core Gameplay
- **Endless running mechanics** with increasing difficulty  
- **Jump** and **crouch** controls for player movement  
- **Dynamic obstacle generation** (rocks, etc.)  
- **Accurate collision detection** and grounded alignment for all obstacles  
- **Score system** that tracks how long you survive  
- **Restart and game-over mechanics**

### 🎨 Visuals & Art
- Retro **pixelated art style**  
- All assets dynamically scaled for different resolutions  
- Smooth **cat animation** using sprite sheets  
- Proper **ground alignment** with vertical offsets (e.g., `rockYOffset`)

### 🧠 Technical Highlights
- Developed in **C#** using the **MonoGame framework**  
- Organized with a clean, modular architecture:
  - `Game1.cs` → Main game loop and logic  
  - `Player.cs` → Handles movement, jumping, and crouching  
  - `Obstacle.cs` → Manages spawning and behavior of obstacles  
  - `Content.mgcb` → Asset management and content pipeline  
- Implements **delta time** for consistent movement  
- Efficient rendering using MonoGame’s `SpriteBatch`

## What I learned

- Implementing physics-like behavior in 2D using delta time
- Managing game states (Start, Playing, Game Over)
- Working with the MonoGame content pipeline
- Handling asset scaling and hitbox precision
- Structuring a small game project cleanly for readability and scalability

## Future Improvements

- Add parallax background scrolling
- Introduce power-ups and enemy types
- Add sound effects and background music
- Include a main menu UI and settings
- Integrate leaderboards or save system
